# Decision-Tree-for-Drug-Selection
# Dataset Description :
This dataset contains information about a set of patients who suffered from the same illness and were treated with one of five medications: Drug A, Drug B, Drug C, Drug X, and Drug Y. The goal is to build a model to predict which drug might be appropriate for future patients based on their characteristics.

# Features
Age: The age of the patient.
Sex: The sex of the patient (Male or Female).
Blood Pressure (BP): The blood pressure level of the patient, categorized as LOW, NORMAL, or HIGH.
Cholesterol: The cholesterol level of the patient, categorized as NORMAL or HIGH.
Na_to_K: Sodium to Potassium ratio in the patient's blood.


# Target
The target variable is the drug that each patient responded to, represented as:

Drug A
Drug B
Drug C
Drug X
Drug Y


# Model Application
This dataset is suitable for a multiclass classification task. One approach is to build a decision tree model using the provided features to predict the appropriate drug for a patient. The decision tree model can then be used to predict the class of an unknown patient or prescribe a drug to a new patient based on their characteristics.
